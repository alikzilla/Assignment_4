/*
The issue with this code is related to the context (this) in JavaScript.
When you assign a method to a variable like stoleSecretIdentity, 
it loses its original context. In this case, this inside stoleSecretIdentity will not refer to the hero object, 
causing it to return undefined.

To fix this issue, you can explicitly bind the context to the hero object when assigning the method to stoleSecretIdentity. 
You can use the .bind() method or an arrow function. Here's how you can do it:
